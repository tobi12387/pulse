# Pulse Performance-OS Backlog

Purpose: keep autonomous work pointed at the 2026 Performance Operating System goal without re-deriving the next slice from a long PR history.

Use this file after `docs/ai/current-focus.md` and before opening broad code context. This file is the hard ordering for product work unless Tobi explicitly reverses it.

## Build Rules

- Prefer weekly, package-shaped PRs over isolated micro-slices. A package PR should usually contain 3-5 tightly related changes that share one user-facing outcome and one verification surface.
- A micro-slice is allowed for urgent bugs, regressions, CI/deploy repair, docs-only workflow updates, or when a package would cross unrelated ownership boundaries.
- Every product PR must name one backlog track: `Tagesentscheidung`, `Trainingsanpassung` or `Lernschleifen`.
- Work outside those tracks is deferred unless Tobi explicitly reprioritizes it.
- Keep Home as the daily translator, Plan as the adaptation/execution surface, Data as the evidence workbench and Settings as readiness/diagnostics unless fresh route evidence proves a clearer navigation.
- Do not add hidden Plan, Garmin, Coach, notification or LLM writes. Action contracts must preview what changes after a click.

## Verification Rules

- For `frontend/src/pulse/daily-decision.ts`, add or extend fast unit/golden scenario tests before Playwright. Cover signal priority, CTA label/target, safest option and goal impact.
- Use Playwright for 1-2 package-level UI smokes that prove rendered route behavior, responsive safety or click-path handoff.
- If a package touches several Home decision signals, move toward a data-driven signal registry/priority table instead of adding more one-off branches.
- PR bodies should name the track, package outcome, local checks, CI state and whether deploy is required.

## Automerge Rule

- When local checks are green and CI has no special review risk, prefer GitHub auto-merge instead of blocking the session on active waiting.
- Inspect and fix failed checks.
- Runtime changes still deploy only after the PR is merged to `main`.
- Docs-only and planning-only PRs normally do not require server deploy.

## Track 1: Tagesentscheidung

Status: **shipped baseline**. PRs #464-#466 delivered completed-day Daily Decision golden coverage, Home-to-Activity closure evidence, Activity Detail language alignment and the first local Daily Decision signal registry. Reopen Track 1 only for regressions or a new explicit package.

Package: **Home lernt abgeschlossene Tage vollstaendig.**

Outcome: completed days become learning evidence, not loose ends. After planned or off-plan training, Pulse names the smallest closure step, explains why it matters and routes to the exact existing surface that captures the evidence.

Why it matters: this is the WHOOP/Oura daily clarity plus MacroFactor-style learning loop joined to Garmin/device reality and TrainingPeaks-style plan feedback.

Shipped package PRs:

- Add Daily Decision golden scenarios for completed-day feedback, fueling, recovery, goal and Garmin precedence.
- Keep the existing Home-to-Activity click path as one desktop/mobile smoke.
- Make Activity Detail evidence quality mirror Home closure language for RPE, GI comfort, carbs, duration context and measured hydration context.
- Prepare the first local signal registry/priority table when touching more than one signal branch.

Done evidence:

- Fast contract tests prove leading factor, CTA, target path, safest option and result preview for the main completed-day cases.
- One rendered Home smoke proves the user can click to the exact capture surface.
- No Plan/Garmin write happens until an explicit apply/sync action on the destination surface.

## Track 2: Trainingsanpassung

Status: **shipped baseline**. The shared weekly decision contract now appears in Plan Review and Change Inbox, exposes preview-only `Beibehalten`, `Anpassen` and `Spaeter` controls, ties goal/recovery/Garmin debt into one decision language, and receives Home/Data Plan-/Load handoffs at `#plan-weekly-decision`. Reopen Track 2 only for regressions or a new explicit package.

Package: **Plan macht Wochenentscheidung aktiver.**

Outcome: Plan feels like a weekly command surface, not a list plus diagnostics. It tells Tobi what changed, what decision is open, and what accepting/changing/deferring does to the week.

Why it matters: this is the TrainerRoad/TrainingPeaks/JOIN/Runna layer. Pulse already has many deterministic signals; the next gain is making the weekly control loop obvious and trustworthy.

Best next package PR:

- Make Plan Review and Change Inbox share one current weekly decision contract: learned, changed, risk, next explicit action.
- Add a read-only week impact preview for accepting, adapting or intentionally deferring a plan change.
- Tie Goal Projection, Recovery pressure and Garmin execution debt into the same weekly decision language without automatic Garmin writes.
- Add fast tests proving accept/change/defer previews do not mutate plan or Garmin before explicit apply.

Done evidence:

- Plan first viewport exposes one current weekly job and one primary next action.
- Tests prove preview-only behavior before explicit apply.
- Home and Data deep links land on the same weekly decision evidence without duplicate copy.

## Track 3: Lernschleifen

Status: **next active package**.

Package: **Data erklaert Trainingsrisiko und Analyse naechste Handlung besser.**

Outcome: deep evidence ends in a concrete next action only when it is actionable. Data > Analyse explains whether the evidence changes today's action, changes a plan decision, or stays as watch context.

Why it matters: this is Intervals.icu/WKO depth translated into Oura/WHOOP-style daily clarity and MacroFactor-like coaching updates. It prevents more analytics from becoming more interpretation work.

Best next package PR:

- Standardize Data > Analyse action contracts across Personal Response, Durability, Power quality, Goal Projection, Decision Quality and Fueling evidence.
- Add fast tests for mapping analysis signal type to CTA label, target path and result preview.
- Only escalate analysis evidence into Home when it beats current-day Recovery, Mental, Data trust, Fueling or Garmin execution needs.
- Keep nutrition trend summaries gated until comparable complete evidence exists.

Done evidence:

- Data analysis tests prove each actionable signal has a target and correct result preview.
- Home tests prove non-actionable watch evidence does not steal the leading factor.
- Route evidence shows Data remains an evidence workbench, not a second Home dashboard.

## Supporting Build-Speed Work

These improvements are mandatory support for the three tracks, not a fourth product track:

- Keep `docs/ai/current-focus.md` below roughly 80 short lines and link detailed status to this file, the canonical roadmap and decisions.
- Extract Daily Decision contract fixtures from Playwright into fast unit/golden tests.
- Introduce data-driven signal registry/priority tables when package work touches multiple signal contracts.
- Prefer package PRs with 3-5 related changes over repeated one-signal PRs when the evidence surface is shared.

## Evidence Gates

- Nutrition trend summaries stay gated until at least three comparable complete `during` logs exist with carbs, duration/activity context and GI comfort.
- Sodium, heat and sweat-rate claims remain explicit evidence gaps until measured.
- Real Garmin calendar/workout writes are only run for explicit sync repair/testing.
- Push activation and iPhone certificate trust remain manual per browser/device.
- Native iOS remains a future decision only after repeated real iPhone/PWA friction is recorded.
